## To Dos:

1) Improve how the event gets fired. Currently using keydown - which fetches the content 1 charactor behind of the total string value.

2) Sync and fetch data (https request) so users can fetch the latest shortcut data when they're connected to the internet - write the latest data to a local json file.

3) Store most active shortcuts so users can quickly find those actions.
